## Overview
### Description
Use the Super Cool Disassembler That does Cool Thingsâ„¢ to cheat on your assembly homework! Kidding. I don't condone academic dishonesty.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Utility
- **Mobile:** This app would benefit from a web format so that it can be utilized from several different device types, not limited to architecture.
- **Story:** allows users to share their EDC combinations
- **Market:** Those who are interested in creating a program similar to one they already have.
- **Scope:** centralize one portable tool for translating machine code into human-readable format (MIPS instructions) 

## Demos
Drag and drop a txt file into the file field on the left. Don't have a txt file? Convert your object file to txt file using this C++ program. View MIPS instructions on the right. *Note that there currently is no implementation of pseudoinstructions.*
